# Machine Learning-Projects
### Linear Regression Project  
Developed a model that can help the company to figure out if they should focus on mobile app or website based on   users
 * Conclusion.
     - The features such as length of membership, average session length, and time spent on the app effects the most, money spent by the users.
     - Length of memebership causes the maximum increase of money spent by users.
     - Before we  can make any decision come the conclusion, the comapny has to consider or explore other factors such as what is the relation between length of membership and app, since it is the length of memebership that influence the user to spend money.
     
### Logistic Regression project
 Created a model that predicts whether or not the user will click on advertisements based on the user features.
  * Genrated classification report and confusion matrix to check the performance of the model. 

### KNN project
Developed KNN model on artificial data to predict the target class
* Applied elbow method to choose the best K value to improve the model for better precision and recall.

### Random Forest Project
Created Random forest model/ Decision tree model to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full.
* Investigated two models or methods, classification tree and random forest tree, to find out which has a better accuracy to predict the outcomes.
* Random forest did a better job (higher recall) in indentifying the borrowers who didn't pay back the loan in full.
* Feature engineering is reqired to further improve the accuracy of the model.

### Support Vector Machines Project
Created SVM model to classify three species of flower - Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica
* Used Gridsearch to tune the parameters of the model.

### Tools used: 
Python, Jupyter notebook, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit learn/Sklearn
